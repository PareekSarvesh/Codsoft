Hello everyone, this is my first repository created for the company Codsoft, where we were given a task of creating 3 projects.
1) A landing page - A basic landing page that gives and seeks some information about the brand or the content that it has been made for
2) Our Own Portfolio - This was for making our own portfolio, with some instructions set, ex. the what the contents should have and etc.
3) A Calculator - for almost any language that we learn, a basic project that is always done, has to have a calculator in itself, so using HTML, CSS and JS a calculator that has the light and the dark modes, providing the users to have a tool that soothes their eyes and is comfortable to use.

Hope, you like the projects, do provide your reviews for how you felt like to use the projects
